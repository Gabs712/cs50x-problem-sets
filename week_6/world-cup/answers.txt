Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, sometimes Brazil won, sometimes Belgium. But with a large number of simulations, pretty much always Belgium won.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

100000 simulations should be enough, the numbers are stable and the performance is high
